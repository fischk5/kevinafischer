## NextJS Specific Guidelines  

- Follow Next.js App Router directory structure conventions  
- Minimize usage of 'use client', useEffect, and useState when possible  
- Abstract as much logic from the `page.tsx` files as possible into components for the App Router to work more effectively and move concerns away from the routing logic as much as possible. A noteworthy exception is that fetches to the /api should be handled by the `page.tsx` files with the results passed down to components to maintain a more efficient data flow and avoid tying data fetching with rendering operations.  


## Component Styles  
  
- All components have their specific styles from CSS modules defined in the same directory.  
- All variables without exception will be defined in [globals.css](mdc:c:/Users/fisch/Documents/Projects/tetheros-consulting/client/src/styles/globals.css)
  
## Performance Optimization  

- Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading

## Library Usage  
  
- Handle all date operations and manipulations with date-fns package via the /utils/dateUtils.ts module unless it is simpler to use vanilla typescript

## Types and Interfaces  
  
- Most components will have a Props interface defined in the component file.  
- define and export most types from the /types directory with few exceptions
